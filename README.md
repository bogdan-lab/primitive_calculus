Simply place to check and play with some fun ideas I found

1D nonlinear stuff

Bisection - first order convergence. Terrible method, require specific function and range setup for working

Secant - convergence order is between 1 and 2 (~1.5). Not that bad at all, especially if we don't want take the derivative.

Newton - second order convergence (not always!). Usual dificalies with derivative...

Third order Newton - requires second derivative! It would be much better if we can calculate function derivative analytically. VERY SENSITIVE FOR FUNCTIONS!



TODO:
[] Try out method of deleting roots for searching all solutions
[] Try that thing with normalization of the space for faster convergence in nonlinear systems (Fedorenko)
